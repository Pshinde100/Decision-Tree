# Decision-Tree
Decision tree is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms.  Decision trees are used for both classification and regression problems

A decision tree is a tree where each node represents a feature(attribute), each link(branch) represents a decision(rule) and each leaf represents an outcome(categorical or continues value).
